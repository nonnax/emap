Columnist Jerry Suico Tundag of Cebu-based newspaper The Freeman falsely claimed in a tweet that presidential candidate Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.
had “accepted” the verdict of the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET), which dismissed in its entirety his poll protest against Vice President Leni Robredo
six years ago.
